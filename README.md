# E04a-Sprites Exercise

In this exercise we played with some sprites and moving them around.
main1: we randomly generated 20 sprites and placed them randomly on the screen
main2: we added a second sprite and a second emote
main3: we changed the sprite so that it followed the mouse movement on screen
